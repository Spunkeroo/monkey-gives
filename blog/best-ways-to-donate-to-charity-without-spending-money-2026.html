<h1>Best Ways to Donate to Charity Without Spending Money in 2026</h1>

<p style="color:#999;font-size:14px">Published February 25, 2026 &bull; 14 min read &bull; by <a href="https://monkey.gives/">MonkeyGives</a></p>

<p>You want to help. You care about causes. But your bank account is saying "not right now." I get it. Most of us have been there. Bills are due, groceries keep getting more expensive, and the idea of donating money feels like a luxury you cannot afford.</p>

<p>Here is the thing though. Money is just one way to give. And honestly, it is not even the most valuable way. Charities need your time, your skills, your voice, and your everyday actions just as much as they need cash. Sometimes more.</p>

<p>This guide covers over 20 ways you can make a real difference for causes you care about without spending a single dollar. Some of these are things you can do right now, from your phone, in under five minutes. Others are bigger commitments that can literally change lives.</p>

<p>Let us get into it.</p>

<h2 id="time">1. Give Your Time - Volunteer Opportunities</h2>

<p>Volunteering is the most obvious way to give without money, but most people think it means working at a soup kitchen on Thanksgiving. There are way more options than that:</p>

<h3>Local Volunteering</h3>
<p><strong>Food banks.</strong> Your local food bank needs people to sort, pack, and distribute food year-round. Not just during the holidays. Most food banks are desperately short-staffed from January through October.</p>

<p><strong>Animal shelters.</strong> Walk dogs. Socialize cats. Clean kennels. Many shelters also need foster homes for animals waiting for adoption. Fostering saves lives and costs you very little (most shelters provide food and vet care).</p>

<p><strong>Habitat for Humanity.</strong> Help build homes for families in need. No construction experience required. They teach you everything on site. You can sign up for a single day.</p>

<p><strong>Tutoring and mentoring.</strong> Help kids with homework at after-school programs. Mentor a teenager through Big Brothers Big Sisters. Read to children at the library. Your knowledge is incredibly valuable to a young person who does not have adults to help them.</p>

<p><strong>Senior centers and nursing homes.</strong> Visit elderly residents who have no family nearby. Play cards, read to them, or just sit and talk. Loneliness is a serious health issue for seniors, and your time literally extends lives.</p>

<h3>Virtual Volunteering</h3>
<p>Cannot leave the house? No problem. You can volunteer from your couch:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Crisis Text Line</strong> - Train to be a crisis counselor via text message. Help people in their darkest moments from your phone.</li>
<li><strong>Be My Eyes</strong> - Help blind and low-vision people with everyday tasks through video calls. Takes just a few minutes per call.</li>
<li><strong>Translators Without Borders</strong> - If you speak multiple languages, translate documents for humanitarian organizations.</li>
<li><strong>United Nations Online Volunteering</strong> - Write, research, design, or code for UN projects from anywhere in the world.</li>
<li><strong>Wikipedia editing</strong> - Improve articles on topics you know about. Millions of people will benefit from your knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="skills">2. Give Your Skills - Pro Bono Work</h2>

<p>Whatever you do for a living, there is a charity that needs that skill. This is called pro bono work and it is incredibly valuable:</p>

<p><strong>Graphic designers</strong> can create logos, flyers, and social media graphics for small nonprofits that cannot afford to hire a designer.</p>

<p><strong>Web developers</strong> can build or improve websites for charities. Organizations like Code for America always need tech volunteers.</p>

<p><strong>Accountants</strong> can help nonprofits with bookkeeping, tax prep, or financial planning. Many small charities do not have anyone who understands finances.</p>

<p><strong>Lawyers</strong> can provide pro bono legal services through organizations like the ABA Free Legal Answers program.</p>

<p><strong>Photographers</strong> can donate their time to capture events, create marketing materials, or document stories for nonprofits.</p>

<p><strong>Writers</strong> can help with grant writing, newsletters, press releases, and website content.</p>

<p>Check out platforms like Catchafire and Taproot Foundation. They match skilled volunteers with nonprofits that need exactly what you can do. All remote, all on your schedule.</p>

<h2 id="stuff">3. Give Your Stuff - Donate Items You Already Own</h2>

<p>Look around your house right now. I guarantee there are things you do not use that someone else desperately needs:</p>

<p><strong>Clothes.</strong> Coats, shoes, business attire, children's clothing. Donate to Goodwill, Salvation Army, or local shelters. Dress for Success specifically takes professional clothing for people entering the workforce.</p>

<p><strong>Books.</strong> Libraries accept donations. Little Free Libraries need books constantly. Many prisons accept book donations. Books to Prisoners is a great organization for this.</p>

<p><strong>Electronics.</strong> Old laptops, tablets, and phones can be refurbished and given to students or low-income families. World Computer Exchange and human-I-T accept tech donations.</p>

<p><strong>Furniture.</strong> The Salvation Army and Habitat for Humanity ReStore pick up furniture donations for free. Your old couch could furnish an apartment for a family starting over.</p>

<p><strong>Food.</strong> Non-perishable items that are still in date. Canned goods, pasta, rice, peanut butter. Check your pantry right now. There is probably something in there you bought and never opened.</p>

<p><strong>Eyeglasses.</strong> Lions Club International collects and redistributes used eyeglasses to people in developing countries. Drop them off at most LensCrafters or Walmart Vision Centers.</p>

<p>Pro tip: take photos of everything you donate and keep receipts. Many donated items are tax-deductible, which technically means the government is paying you back for your generosity.</p>

<h2 id="voice">4. Give Your Voice - Advocate and Raise Awareness</h2>

<p>Never underestimate the power of simply talking about a cause. Awareness is the first step toward action:</p>

<p><strong>Share on social media.</strong> When you share a charity's post, you are exposing their mission to your entire network. Some of those people will donate, volunteer, or share further. It costs you nothing and takes 10 seconds.</p>

<p><strong>Sign petitions.</strong> Sites like Change.org and Care2 host petitions on thousands of issues. Signatures influence lawmakers and corporations. It takes 30 seconds.</p>

<p><strong>Contact your representatives.</strong> A phone call or email to your senator, congressperson, or local official about an issue you care about is one of the most impactful things you can do. Elected officials track constituent contacts and use them to make decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Leave reviews for nonprofits.</strong> Review charities you support on Google, GreatNonprofits, or Facebook. Positive reviews help organizations attract new donors and volunteers.</p>

<p><strong>Talk to people.</strong> Have conversations about causes you care about. At dinner, at work, at the gym. When people hear a compelling personal story about why something matters, it sticks with them far longer than any ad or post.</p>

<h2 id="clicks">5. Give Your Clicks - Passive Donation Apps and Sites</h2>

<p>These tools let you generate donations just by doing things you already do every day:</p>

<p><strong>Tab for a Cause.</strong> This browser extension shows an ad every time you open a new tab. The ad revenue gets donated to charity. You choose which charity. You literally donate by browsing the internet.</p>

<p><strong>Ecosia.</strong> A search engine that plants trees with its ad revenue. Every 45 searches plants a tree. Just switch your default search engine and forget about it. They have planted over 200 million trees.</p>

<p><strong>FreeRice.</strong> Answer trivia questions and for every correct answer, the World Food Programme donates rice to people in need. Fun and productive. Play it instead of scrolling social media.</p>

<p><strong>Charity Miles.</strong> An app that donates money to charity for every mile you walk, run, or bike. About 25 cents per mile for biking and 10 cents per mile for walking or running. Just turn it on before you exercise.</p>

<p><strong>ShareTheMeal.</strong> The official UN app for fighting hunger. You can donate as little as 80 cents to feed a child for a day, but they also have features where sponsors pay when you engage with content. Check for free-to-you donation options.</p>

<h2 id="body">6. Give Your Body - Donate Blood, Plasma, and More</h2>

<p>Your body produces things that can literally save lives:</p>

<p><strong>Blood donation.</strong> The American Red Cross always needs blood. One donation can save up to three lives. It takes about an hour and you usually get free snacks and juice. You can donate every 56 days.</p>

<p><strong>Plasma donation.</strong> Plasma is used to create treatments for burn victims, hemophilia patients, and people with immune deficiencies. Some plasma centers even pay you, so this one can actually make you money while saving lives.</p>

<p><strong>Bone marrow registration.</strong> Join the Be The Match registry. All it takes is a cheek swab mailed to your home. If you match someone who needs a transplant, you could be their only hope. Registration is free for ages 18 to 40.</p>

<p><strong>Organ donor registration.</strong> Sign up as an organ donor through your state's DMV or Donate Life. One organ donor can save up to eight lives and improve dozens more through tissue donation.</p>

<p><strong>Hair donation.</strong> Organizations like Wigs for Kids and Children With Hair Loss accept hair donations to make wigs for children who have lost their hair due to medical conditions. You need at least 12 inches of hair.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="data">7. Give Your Data - Citizen Science and Research</h2>

<p>Scientists need your help and you do not need a science degree to give it:</p>

<p><strong>Folding@home.</strong> Install software on your computer that uses your spare processing power to simulate protein folding. This helps researchers develop treatments for diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, and COVID. Your computer works while you sleep.</p>

<p><strong>Zooniverse.</strong> The world's largest citizen science platform. Classify galaxies, transcribe historical records, identify wildlife, and more. Real scientists use your contributions in published research papers.</p>

<p><strong>eBird.</strong> If you like watching birds, log your sightings on eBird. Your observations contribute to the largest biodiversity database in the world and help scientists track bird populations and migration patterns.</p>

<p><strong>Galaxy Zoo.</strong> Help classify galaxies from real telescope images. Astronomers have discovered entirely new types of galaxies thanks to citizen scientists on this platform.</p>

<p><strong>Medical research surveys.</strong> Many universities run online studies that need participants. Sites like Prolific and ResearchMatch connect you with legitimate research studies. Some pay, some do not, but all contribute to advancing human knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="shopping">8. Give While Shopping - Cashback and Roundup Programs</h2>

<p>If you are going to spend money anyway, these programs turn your purchases into donations at no extra cost to you:</p>

<p><strong>Amazon Smile.</strong> While Amazon discontinued AmazonSmile in early 2023, many retailers have launched similar programs. Always check if your favorite stores have a charitable giving feature at checkout.</p>

<p><strong>iGive.</strong> Shop at over 2,000 online stores through iGive and a percentage of your purchase goes to the charity of your choice. You pay the same prices. The donation comes from the retailer's side.</p>

<p><strong>Giving Assistant.</strong> Similar to iGive. Shop through their links and earn cashback that gets donated to charity. Covers hundreds of stores.</p>

<p><strong>Grocery store loyalty programs.</strong> Many grocery chains like Kroger and Publix have community giving programs tied to your loyalty card. Link your card to a local charity and a percentage of your purchases goes to them automatically.</p>

<p><strong>Credit card rewards.</strong> Some credit cards let you donate your cashback or points directly to charity. Check if yours offers this option. You already earned those points, so this is genuinely free.</p>

<h2 id="workplace">9. Give Through Your Employer - Matching and Programs</h2>

<p>Your job might already have ways for you to give:</p>

<p><strong>Volunteer time off (VTO).</strong> Many companies give employees paid time off specifically for volunteering. Ask your HR department. You might be leaving free volunteer hours on the table.</p>

<p><strong>Matching gifts.</strong> If you do donate even a small amount, your employer might match it. Some companies match dollar for dollar. Some match double. This is free money for your charity.</p>

<p><strong>Skill-based volunteering days.</strong> Some companies organize team volunteer days where you use your professional skills to help nonprofits. Participate in these. They make a bigger impact than you think.</p>

<p><strong>Workplace giving campaigns.</strong> United Way campaigns, combined federal campaign (for government employees), and similar programs make it easy to give small amounts through payroll deduction.</p>

<h2 id="creative">10. Creative Ways Most People Never Think Of</h2>

<p>Here are some less obvious ways to give without money:</p>

<p><strong>Donate your birthday.</strong> Ask friends and family to donate to a charity instead of buying you gifts. Facebook makes this incredibly easy with their birthday fundraiser feature.</p>

<p><strong>Leave reviews for small businesses.</strong> Okay this is not technically a charity donation. But a positive review for a struggling small business costs you nothing and can mean the difference between them surviving and closing. That is community impact.</p>

<p><strong>Teach someone something.</strong> Teach a neighbor's kid to read. Show a senior citizen how to use their phone. Help an immigrant practice English. Teaching is one of the most generous things a person can do.</p>

<p><strong>Be an organ courier.</strong> Organizations like Mercy Flights need volunteer pilots and drivers to transport organs for transplant. If you have a pilot's license, this is a remarkable way to save lives.</p>

<p><strong>Host a donation drive.</strong> Organize a coat drive, food drive, or school supply drive in your neighborhood. You do not donate money. You just organize the collection and delivery. Your community does the rest.</p>

<p><strong>Compost for community gardens.</strong> If you have a yard, start composting and donate the compost to community gardens that grow food for low-income families.</p>

<p><strong>Lend your tools.</strong> Have a lawnmower, pressure washer, or toolbox collecting dust in your garage? Lend them to neighbors or community organizations doing cleanup projects.</p>

<h2 id="maximize">11. How to Maximize Your Non-Financial Giving</h2>

<p>Want to make the biggest possible impact without spending money? Follow these principles:</p>

<p><strong>Be consistent.</strong> One hour of volunteering every week for a year is worth infinitely more than a single 8-hour day. Charities need reliable people they can count on.</p>

<p><strong>Use your unique skills.</strong> A web developer building a donation page for a charity creates far more value than that same person sorting cans at a food bank. Match your giving to your strengths.</p>

<p><strong>Focus on one or two causes.</strong> Spreading yourself across 10 charities means none of them get meaningful help from you. Pick one or two and go deep.</p>

<p><strong>Bring friends.</strong> Every person you recruit to volunteer doubles the impact. Make giving social. Volunteer with friends. Start a giving group.</p>

<p><strong>Track your impact.</strong> Keep a log of your volunteer hours, items donated, and causes supported. Not to brag, but because seeing your impact accumulate motivates you to keep going.</p>

<div class="faq" id="faq">
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<details>
<summary>Can you really make a difference without donating money?</summary>
<p>Absolutely. Many charities say volunteers are even more valuable than cash donations. A volunteer who shows up consistently provides labor, skills, and dedication that money alone cannot buy. Your time, expertise, advocacy, and physical donations all create real, measurable impact.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the easiest way to help charity without spending money?</summary>
<p>Switch your search engine to Ecosia (plants trees with ad revenue), install Tab for a Cause (donates when you open new tabs), and share charity posts on social media. These take seconds to set up and generate donations passively while you go about your normal day.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How many hours should I volunteer per week?</summary>
<p>Even one to two hours per week makes a meaningful difference. The key is consistency over quantity. Most organizations prefer a volunteer who comes one hour weekly for six months over someone who does one 8-hour day and disappears.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I get tax benefits from donating items instead of money?</summary>
<p>Yes. Donated items like clothing, furniture, electronics, and vehicles can be claimed as tax deductions if you itemize. Keep detailed records of what you donated, its condition, and the fair market value. Get a receipt from the receiving organization.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Is donating blood actually helpful?</summary>
<p>Extremely. Every two seconds, someone in the United States needs blood. One blood donation can save up to three lives. The supply is always critically low. The American Red Cross considers blood donation one of the most impactful things an individual can do.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I find legitimate volunteer opportunities near me?</summary>
<p>Check VolunteerMatch.org, Idealist.org, and your local United Way website. Most also have virtual opportunities. Your city or county government website typically lists volunteer programs too. Always verify that the organization is legitimate before committing your time.</p>
</details>

<h2>You Do Not Need Money to Change the World</h2>

<p>Every single day you have opportunities to make someone's life better. You have time. You have skills. You have a voice. You have things you do not use anymore. You have a body that produces blood. You have a computer that can process data while you sleep.</p>

<p>Stop waiting until you "have enough money" to start giving. Start with what you have right now. Pick one thing from this list and do it today. Then pick another one tomorrow.</p>

<p>The world does not change because of a few big donors writing big checks. It changes because of millions of ordinary people doing small things every day.</p>

<p>You are one of those people. Start today.</p>
